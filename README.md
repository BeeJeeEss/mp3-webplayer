# MP3 webplayer
# NOT FINISHED YET
It's just a simple software which allowes you to play songs you have downloaded and saved in folder below 

`./server/static/`

## an instruction
Well prepared directory with mp3 files should contain an image named `cover.jpg` - it's gonna be an album cover, displayed on the left side of the app.

### comments
I know nobody will read it, much less download it but I really wanted to write a little bit more than just a project title in this README.
The beta tester who spotted a mistake related to a bad one of the albums cover is [@Wolaxn23](https://bit.ly/2QF7Kvr).
